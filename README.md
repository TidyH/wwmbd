# WWMBD: A Personal Learning Project Inspired by Michael Burry

## Introduction
Welcome to WWMBD (What Would Michael Burry Do?), a desktop GUI application designed to help users make informed investment decisions. This project is a personal learning endeavor, aimed at improving my proficiency in programming with Golang.

**Note:** This is a personal project, and it should not be considered financial advice. Use at your own risk. As this is a learning project, issues are preferred over pull requests but any dialog is welcome.

## Background and Goals

As a DevOps Engineer looking to expand my skillset beyond work-related projects, I'm using WWMBD as an opportunity to learn and practice:

1. Golang: To become more proficient in Go (Golang) programming language.  
2. GUI Development: To explore GUI development with Fyne.io library.  
3. Algorithmic Trading: To delve into the world of algorithmic trading and stock market analysis.  

## Features:
- **Stock Research**: Gather information on stocks' financials to inform investment decisions.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Run stock financials through algorithms to generate predictions and recommendations.
- **Actionable Insights**: Receive suggestions on what actions to take (buy, hold, sell, short, or call) based on the analysis.
- **SP 500 Reports**: Gather reports from the S&P 500 for review and analysis.

## Requirements
- **Git**: This project uses Git for version control. Make sure you have it installed on your machine.  
- **Go (Golang)**: The minimum required Go version is 1.22 or higher. Ensure you're running a compatible Go environment.  
- **Custom Library (fyne.io)**: WWMBD utilizes a custom library from fyne.io, which might require separate installation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Git repository using git clone https://github.com/tidyh/wwmbd.git (or your preferred method).
2. Install Go 1.22 or higher and ensure it's properly set up on your machine.
3. Enter directory and run go run cmd/main.go
